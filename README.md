# OOPs-Task-Library-Catalogue
This repository is created to add Python programs that I practice on.
The task is as follows
1.	Write Code for the below class diagram (some functions are not shown in the diagram)
a.	Create a class Author with only one-member Name - string \
b.	Create a class Book with given member variables – \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; i.	  ISBN – string \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ii.  	Authors (of type class Author) – List of type Author. To store multiple authors of one book \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; iii.	Title - string \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; iv. 	Subject - string \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; v.	  DDS Number - int \
c.	 Create a class Catalog with one alteast dataframe as member function to store entries of all books in the catalog. You can add other required member functions. and then add        following functions \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; i.	add_book() \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ii.	remove_book() \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; iii.	display_catalogue() – print the complete catalogue dataframe on console. \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; iv.	search_book(book_title) – search book for the given title in the catalogue. If found, then return all the information of that book as pandas dataframe \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; v.	search_books(subject) – search all the books for the given subject and return them as pandas dataframe. If no books on that subject found then  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     return -1 and also print “No books on this subject found” \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; vi.	generate_json() – this function should write the complete catalogue into one json file with name “catalog.json” and save in the same folder of      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; project. \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; d.	Add proper comments where needed. \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; e.	Also add __init__.py file in the project. \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; f.	Create a github repo with name Library_catalog and add the project to it. \
